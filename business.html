      <h2>Budget 2023-24</h2>
      <p> It’s a typical Dar budget with some populistic flavor. Penalize anyone
        who makes money legally and wants to grow their business in the formal
        sector. “That is Dar’s philosophy of life”, lamented a businessman.
        Taxing those who are already taxed is the only trick in Dar’s playbook
        and it seems this time he has swallowed all its pages.Beyond the 10
        percent increase in super tax on those who are making money and already
        documented, and an additional unclear measure of windfall tax on the
        same group; there is nothing to take home on tax policy or collection
        measure. Rest, populistic touch includes adhoc increases in salaries and
        pension. The budget is as ad hoc as Dar’s landing in finance ministry
        last year.</p>
