      <h2>Health And Science News</h2>
      <p> HEALTH & SCIENCE section helps readers make sense of the many products, claims and studies that emerge daily. Through lively, sometimes humorous, but always rigorously researched stories, we try to separate the truths from the half-truths to help people make smarter HEALTH & SCIENCE care choices for themselves and their families.

        We strip away the jargon to help readers understand the cutting-edge science and technology that affects their lives. Our columnists and reporters tackle topics such as the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, alternative energy, rockets and dinosaurs. The clear, fun graphics of the weekly feature “Urban Jungle” are a great way for students to understand the changing natural world at our doorsteps.
        
        Whether we are exploring the effect of binge drinking on teen brains or explaining how touch screens actually work, our approach is one that you’ll probably want to encourage in your students.
        
        We practice some basic principles in reporting on HEALTH & SCIENCE:
        
        We insist on getting information from the most reliable sources—the respected authorities in a particular field and the most solid studies in peer-reviewed medical journals.
        
        We’re fiercely independent of any commercial interest or advocacy group.
        
        We respect our readers’ demand for good science, clear jargon-free language and well-labeled illustrations.</p>
