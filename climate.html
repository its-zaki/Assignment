      <h2>Climate News</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing us today. It
        involves many dimensions – science, economics, society, politics, and
        moral and ethical questions – and is a global problem, felt on local
        scales, that will be around for thousands of years. Carbon dioxide, the
        heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is the primary driver of recent global
        warming, lingers in the atmosphere for many thousands of years, and the
        planet (especially the ocean) takes a while to respond to warming. So
        even if we stopped emitting all greenhouse gases today, global warming
        and climate change will continue to affect future generations. In this
        way, humanity is “committed” to some level of climate change
