        transportation, this cost is not similar across incomes. Lower income
        households generally pay a larger portion of their expenditure on
        transportation and as people move up in income brackets, they pay a
        smaller portion on transportation. The lowest income is burdened with
        the largest portion of expenditure. In 2016, in the US, the lowest
        earning 20% of the population earned an average of $11,933, and spent an
        average of $3497 (29%) on transportation costs. The poorest get hit the
        hardest by the (lack of) transport system. For those making roughly
        $30,000 a year, their transportation expenditure was about 22%, then 17%
        for the next quintile. As Americans move from lower to higher income,
        the portion of their expenditure going towards transportation decreases.
        This makes sense. Personal vehicles are not cheap, and are not
        subsidized. Because American cities fail to provide people with
        alternative transportation options, people are forced to travel by
        personal vehicles. This leaves people with low incomes left with few
        options. While criticisms of lack of public transportation focus on the
        toll to the environment, they should also consider the issue of equity.
        Lack of public transportation is a financial burden – by not having good
        options, people are forced to make burdensome financial decisions and
        are left in a cycle of poverty that becomes harder to escape. ITDP’s Joe
        Chestnut, who wrote the report, Indicators for Sustainable Mobility
        concluded,
