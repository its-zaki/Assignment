        The Netflix crackdown on password sharing is in its early days in the
        U.S., but it appears to be having the effect the streamer was looking
        for – a boost to its subscriber base. Since alerting its members in late
        May of its new password sharing policy, Netflix had its four single
        largest days of signing up U.S. customers since data provider Antenna
        began tracking the service. In that time, Netflix has seen nearly
        100,000 daily signups on two of the days, according to the report from
        Antenna. On May 23, Netflix began sending out emails to members that it
        was changing its sharing guidelines, namely that accounts were only to
        be shared within the same household. “Your Netflix account is for you
        and the people you live with — your household,” the company said in an
        email that has been sent to members since then. As part of the new
        policy, members have two options for the people using their passwords
        outside of their household. Either transfer the profile to the person
        outside of their household so the person can begin a new membership that
        they pay for on their own, or the member pays an extra fee of $7.99 a
        month per person outside of their household. Since the email began
        rolling out, average daily signups to Netflix reached 73,000, a 102%
        increase from the prior 60-day average, which surpassed the spike in
        sign-ups during the initial lockdowns of the pandemic, according to
        Antenna.
